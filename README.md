# charged-up-robot
Team 4533's robot code for the 2023 FRC game, Charged Up
but updated for 2024 WPIlib and vendor lib changes

Many subsystems of the 2023 have been removed as they are no longer on the old 2023 system chassis, 
and we still need to drive the chassis for practice driving.

default should be fieldcentric

Left stick is X/Y 
Right stick's X axis is Rotation.

Those stick actions are defined in src\main\java\frc\robot\subsystems\Swerve.java
